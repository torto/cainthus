# Project Cainthus

## Technologies to front

- React: Lib single application
- Redux: Work with stories in the React
- Axios: Execute all requests
- Styled Components: CssInJs
- Webpack 4: A bundler for javascript
- Babel: Javascript compiler
- Jest: Test all JavaScript code
- Chai: Assertion library (better than jest)
- Sinon: Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript
- React-thunk: Async middleware for Redux.
- MomentJs: Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.
- Enzyme: Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.
- react-epic-spinners: Spinners to React
- react-stack-grid: Pinterest like layout components for React.js
- react-waypoint: A React component to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element

I didn't use react-lazyload because this project is very small, but if it is necessary to the project is very easy to implement after.
